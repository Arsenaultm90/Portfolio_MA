# Goal of this project

My goal was to complete a portfolio site where I could host links to other projects while learning **Git**, **React**, and Responsive
web design. You'll notice that the template for my portfolio is a Windows 98 simulation, and while this wouldn't be a something
someone would use in a professional environment, I found it to be a good learning experience with **React** and **CSS(SASS)**.

# Frameworks & Libraries

- HTML
- CSS(SASS)
- React
- EmailJS(For contact form)

# Why I built the project this way

The main purpose for this project was to learn workflow, react, and better habits. You may notice that some commits don't have anything written
in them, or that my folder structure isn't quite what it should. All these things were part of my learning exerience and as I continue my education
into development I look forward to coming back to this project and updating it to a professional level.

I also noticed that some people use Material UI, Redux, Node(for email backend/web hosting), and other frameworks/libraries to help them complete
their goals but I opted for a more Vanilla approach so I could learn a few key features well and give me the knowledge to recognize bugs more
easily in the future.

# Future Updates/Changes

When I come back this project I would like to update the following:

- Have better use of React Hooks for cleaner code
- Fix bugs with screen size on the mobile version
- Animations for opening and close Windows
- Better designed windows to display information while still following the Windows98 theme
- Have the title bar of the windows turn into a grey gradiant when you click off of them
- Have a startup screen that loads you into the website (Maybe with startup sounds, but most people prefer no sound)
- Attempt to add some of the original Windows98 games playable in browser (Solitaire, Minesweeper, Hover, Pinball, Encarta98, etc)
- Have whatever window you have open at the time appear on the taskbar (simply for thematic similarities)
- Complete tests using Jest
- Work on the project using professional workflow (using proper Git functionality with Pull Requests and feature branches, proper design stage)

# Thanks for checking it out :wave:
